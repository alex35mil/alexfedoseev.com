description: Minimalistic new tab replacement for Google Chrome.
tags: dev
---

I’ve been lazily looking for a simple, flexible and lightweight new tab replacement for Google Chrome, but pretty much all of them, even paid ones, are unconfigurable and seem bloated.

All I actually want comes down to:

1. Nice background picture
1. Date and time in a font I like

Since it’s that simple, I just wrote my own thing.

<Highlight> [Tableau](https://github.com/alexfedoseev/tableau) </Highlight>

## Installation

To be honest, I haven’t put much time/efforts in this, so installation is a bit cumbersome and (somewhat) automated only for MacOS users.

<Note> Give me a hint how to simplify it by submitting [issue](https://github.com/alexfedoseev/tableau/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/alexfedoseev/tableau/pulls)! </Note>

### 1. Get extension

Clone repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:alexfedoseev/tableau.git
```

<Note> Or [download it](https://github.com/alexfedoseev/tableau/archive/master.zip) if you are not familiar with terminal. </Note>

### 2. Add images

Drop images you like in the `tableau/backgrounds` folder.

### 3. Build images index

Next, we need to build an index of images for the extension. I do it via `Automator` (sorry, Windows users, I don’t have automated solution for you, but see below **What it actually does**).

1. Find `Build.app` file in the root of repository and open it in `Automator` (DO NOT double-click it, but open `Automator` and then open `Build.app` in it).
1. Switch to **Variables** panel: `View > Variables`
1. Double click `backgrounds` variable and choose `tableau/backgrounds` folder.
1. Save and close.

<Expandable label="See it in action">
  <AnimatedGif
    img={automatorAnimatedGif}
    placement="bleed"
    caption="Configure Build.app in Automator"
  />
</Expandable>

Now, you can double-click `Build.app` and it will create `images.js` file for you.

<Note>FYI It will replace all spaces in image filenames with underscores.</Note>

#### What it actually does

This workflow reads a content of the `tableau/backgrounds` folder and writes images index to the `tableau/images.js` file:

```js
@file: images.js
---

window.IMAGES = [
  "bells.jpg",
  "whistles.png",
  …
];
```

So, how you create and update this file is totally up to you. I.e. you can convert `Build.app` to folder watcher to automatically perform rebuilds or, if you’re Windows user and you have no idea how to write scripts, then you can create it manually and it will work.

### 4. Load extension

Go to a Chrome’s Extensions list:

1. Enable `Developer Mode` (check checkbox in an upper-right corner)
1. Click “Load unpacked extension…” and choose folder with extension.

<Expandable label="See it in action">
  <AnimatedGif img={chromeAnimatedGif} placement="bleed" caption="Load Tableau in Chrome" />
</Expandable>

Open a new tab and enjoy the view!

## Adding new images

Every time you add new images to the `/backgrounds` folder, you should run `Build.app`, then `Reload` extension in Chrome’s Extensions list (there’s a link right under the extension name).

## Customization

The extension doesn’t have any special configuration UI, but you can change just about everything by editing `index.html`, `index.css` & `index.js` files. The source code is dumb simple and it’s around 100 LOC incl. HTML & CSS.

The most common thing you probably will want to change is a font-face. You can do it by editing line `#2` in the `index.css`.

That’s pretty much all. Enjoy!
