title: Fight for Your Hotkeys

Today I've been overhauling my Xcode setup, including hotkeys. When I attempted to assign `⌘ ⌃ D` to the “Show code review” action, I got a warning that the operating system already uses this combination, hence it wouldn't work. I checked, and indeed it was used to show the definition of the selected word.

I navigated to the `System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts` to reassign or disable this shortcut, but there was no such entry. Doh!

I felt like insisting on using this hotkey for the diff view in the Xcode, so I started digging. After some googling, I found a `com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist` property list that holds a subset of system shortcuts.

Since `plist` files are binaries, it requires special tooling to inspect them. It can be  Xcode or `PlistBuddy` cli utility.

```sh
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist
```

The output was puzzling.

```
Dict {
    AppleSymbolicHotKeys = Dict {
        12 = Dict {
            enabled = true
            value = Dict {
                type = standard
                parameters = Array {
                    65535
                    122
                    8650752
                }
            }
        }
        21 = Dict {
            enabled = false
            value = Dict {
                type = standard
                parameters = Array {
                    56
                    28
                    1835008
                }
            }
        }
		// many more...
    }
}
```

[Further investigation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21878482/what-do-the-parameter-values-in-applesymbolichotkeys-plist-dict-represent) revealed that the entry of `AppleSymbolicHotKeys` dict contains:
- `key`: an int identifier of an action performed on the provided keybinding.
- Value struct:
	- `enabled`: a bool flag that enables/disables a shortcut.
	- `type`: no idea what it is, but I didn't care.
	- `parameters`: an array that encodes a keybinding:
		- #1: ASCII code of the character (or `65535` for non-ASCII characters).
		- #2: the keyboard key code for the character.
		- #3: the sum of the codes of the modifier keys (`⌘`, `⌃`, `⇧` and `⌥`):
```
0: No modifier
1048576: Command
262144: Control
131072: Shift
524288: Option
393216: Shift + Control
655360: Shift + Option
1179648: Shift + Command
786432: Control + Option
1310720: Control + Command
1572864: Option + Command
917504: Shift + Control + Option
1441792: Shift + Control + Command
1703936: Shift + Option + Command
1835008: Control + Option + Command
1966080: Shift + Control + Option + Command
```

The [following gist](https://gist.github.com/jimratliff/227088cc936065598bedfd91c360334e) helps a lot with decoding `parameters` array.

I hoped that if I find the entry with the `parameters` set to `Array {100 2 1310720}` which corresponds to `⌘ ⌃ D` hotkey and flip its `enabled` flag, it will do the trick. But nope, such entry didn't exist in this dict. Doh!

Apparently, this hotkey comes from somewhere else, and at this point, I was supposed to give up, but one more idea crossed my mind. What if it is possible to add the corresponding action id to this `plist` and disable it? All I need is an identifier of this action. It was the hardest part. I still have no idea where these identifiers come from, but there is only one place on the internet where I found the mapping: a forum post that is long gone but stored in the [web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20141112224103/http://hintsforums.macworld.com/showthread.php?t=114785). Someone posted a source of such `plist` with comments on what action corresponds to a specific id.

So after inspecting it very closely, I found something similar:

```
// Dictionary MouseOver - Command, Shift, E
70 = { enabled = 1; value = { parameters = ( 101, 2, 1179648 ); type = standard; }; };
```

And it was exactly what I was looking for. Running this command, I disabled the system shortcut.

```sh
defaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys -dict-add 70 '<dict><key>enabled</key><false/></dict>'
```

The last note is that changes to this file don't apply immediately. It would require a restart. But there is a command that applies changes right here right now:

```sh
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SystemAdministration.framework/Resources/activateSettings -u
```
