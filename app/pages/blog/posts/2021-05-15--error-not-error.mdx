title: Error Not Error
description: A note on the stderr UNIX stream.

I stumbled on a piece of my old code of some CLI utility and remembered what a mess caused my unawareness of this specificity of UNIX streams (I'm not sure if it applies to Windows).

This is really counterintuitive but the `stderr` UNIX stream is not for errors only. It is for everything except the main result of a program.

- Want to print a debug information? Send it to `stderr`.
- Want to ask for a confirmation? Send it to `stderr`.
- Want to print a progress? Send it to `stderr`.
- Want to print a non-critical warning? Send it to `stderr`.
- Want to print an error? Send it to `stderr`.

The only case when you should print to `stdout` is when you have the final result of your program and only this result should go there.

For example, if your program performs a file search, a list of the found files should go to `stdout`.

If your program uploads specified files to a server and you want to print an informational message that all files were successfully uploaded, it should go to `stderr`.

Why? Because users of your program should be able to pipe the results.

Let's say you built a CLI program `answer` that answers the "ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything" (in Rust, of course).

```rust
println!("42");         // the main result, prints to stdout
eprintln!("Answered!"); // informational message, prints to stderr
```

When you run it and pipe the results to `pbcopy` (macOS utility that puts data into a clipboard):

```sh
answer | pbcopy
```

In your terminal you will see:

```
Answered!
```

But in your clipboard, there will be `42`. Because `pbcopy` received data from `stdout` of your program via its `stdin` and placed it into your clipboard.
