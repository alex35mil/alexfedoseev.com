<!-- Bulletproof Enums Using Immutable Records and Flow -->

If you use [`immutable-js`](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) and [`flow`](https://flow.org) in your projects, you can have statically type-checked Enums. This means you’ll get errors right in your editor and on CI if you try to access an Enum property that is misspelled or doesn’t exist.

## Immutable Record
`Record` is a data type that enforces a specific set of allowed string keys on its instances. Once you define what a record consists of, it’s not possible to set unexpected properties on that record instance.

```js
const User = Record({ name: "Default" });
const user = new User();
user.get("name")         // => "Default"
user.set("name", "Alex") // => Record<{ name: "Alex" }>
user.set("namw", "Alex") // => throws
             ^
             typo
```

Record also allows access to its keys using common dot notation:

```js
user.name // => "Default"
```

## Enum
Let’s create a simple Enum factory:

```js
const createEnum = <T: Object>(items: T): Record<T> => {
  const Enum = Record(items);
  return new Enum();
};
const MyEnum = createEnum({ A: "a", B: "b" });
MyEnum.get("A"); // => "a"
MyEnum.get("C"); // => undefined
            ^
            flow throws on unexpected key
```

That’s fine, but sometimes I need helper methods on an enum instance. For example, sometimes I need to get an array of all of the enum’s defined items. Other times, I might need to find the item by the `value` key, e.g.:

```js
const MyEnum = createEnum({
  THING: {
    value: "thing",
    label: "The label for the thing",
  },
});
MyEnum.fromValue("thing").label // => "The label for the thing"
```

## Extended Enum
Luckily, you can extend the Record class and add custom methods to it:

```js
/* @flow */

import { Record } from 'immutable';

interface $EnumInterface<T: Object> extends Record<T> {
  items: Function;
  fromValue: Function;
}

const createEnum = <T: Object>(items: T): $EnumInterface<T> => {
  class Enum extends Record(items) {
    // `this` here is an instance of Record so all instance methods are available!
    items = () => this.toArray();
    fromValue = value => this.find(item => item.value === value);
  }

  return new Enum();
};

export default createEnum;
```

This is how it works in the end:

<AnimatedGif
  src={enumAnimatedGif}
  placement="bleed"
/>

P.S. The examples above work with `immutable@3.8.1`. Typedefs in Immutable v4 (RC at the moment) were significantly improved, but are still in flux for the extended records. Hopefully, these issues will be resolved soon!
