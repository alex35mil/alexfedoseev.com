<!-- ReasonML: Eliminating illegal state -->

Next thing I’d like to share is how [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io) helps in making illegal states unrepresentable in our apps.

Here’s the common pattern of shaping a state in JS:

```js
type State = {|
  loading: boolean,
  data: Data | null,
  error: Error | null,
|};
```

What’s wrong with this? Let’s see how it can be handled in UI:

```js
render = () =>
  <div>
    {this.state.loading && <Spinner />}
    {!this.state.loading &&
      !this.state.error &&
      <div>{this.state.data.foo}</div>
    }
    {this.state.error && <div>{this.state.error.message}</div>}
  </div>
```

It can be improved a bit by re-shaping this state:

```js
type State = {|
  status: "loading" | "ready" | "error",
  data: Data | null,
  error: Error | null,
|};

render = () => {
  switch (this.state.status) {
  case "loading":
    return <Spinner />;
  case "ready":
    return <div>{this.state.data.foo}</div>;
  case "error":
    return <div>{this.state.error.message}</div>;
  default:
    throw new Error("¯\_(ツ)_/¯");
  }
}
```

But the main issue is still there: conditional dependencies between state properties. When `loading === false` (or `status === "ready"`) it implicitly assumes that `data` is not `null`. No guarantees though. Opened doors into an illegal state.

When you use Flow or TypeScript, these tools warn you that `data` might be `null` and you have to add all these annoying checks to calm type system down:

```js
case "ready":
  if (!this.state.data) {
    throw new Error("Uh oh no data");
  }
  return <div>{this.state.data.foo}</div>;
```

I look at the code above and I’m just sad.

## The light
First of all, let me introduce you to the thing called `variant`.

```reason
type status =
| Loading
| Ready
| Error;
```

This is type similar to `enum` in TS except its parts are not strings (nor any other data type you familiar with from JS). These things called `tags` (or `constructors`).

Now the magic moment: every `tag` can hold its own payload!

```reason
type status =
| Loading
| Ready('data)
| Error('error);
```

If you’re not there yet, here’s the code (mixing Reason & JS just for clarity’s sake!):

```reason
type Status =
| Loading
| Ready('data)
| Error('error);

type State = {status: Status};

class Foo extends React.Component {
  state = {status: Loading};

  componentDidMount = () => {
    api.getData()
      .then(data => this.setState({status: Ready(data)}))
      .catch(error => this.setState({status: Error(error)}));
  };

  render = ({state}) => (
    <Layout>
      {
        switch (state.status) {
        | Loading => <Spinner />
        | Ready(data) => <div>{data.foo}</div>
        | Error(error) => <div>{error.message}</div>
        }
      }
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

How beautiful is that! There’s no way to get into an illegal state in this component. Everything is type safe. Combine it with “everything is an expression” in Reason and you can use pattern matching at any point of your JSX render tree (spot `switch` as a child of `<Layout />`).

You know [what to do](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/quickstart-javascript.html).
